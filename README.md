# Realistic Control and Sensing for Autonomous Vehicles

This repository represents code and data utilized in the CDC2019 tutorial presented Thursday in Session ThB26 (Apollon).

# Getting started

## Installation
The tutorial will utilize MATLAB/Simulink with the Robotic Systems Toolbox, and the Control Systems Toolbox, and Simulink Control Design Toolbox.

NOTE: unless you delete the ROS bagfiles, you do not need the robotic systems toolbox to run the remaining code.

To run the CAT Vehicle Software for your own simulation, visit https://cps-vo.org/group/CATVehicleTestbed/wiki

## Download

Retrieve the data and code:

git clone ()


# Generate plots from the paper

Open MATLAB, and in the folder where the files were extracted

```
>> a_early_controllers
```

As well as the later controllers

>> b_data_plotter

After opening Simulink, you can examine car_dynamics.slx to see what the vehicle tuning parameters were like.
